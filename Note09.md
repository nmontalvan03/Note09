# Cloud Architecture

Cloud architecture is integrated into the different technologies to build, create the cloud in the IT environment that separates,
They group and share resources across the network.

# Well Architected Framework

It allows you to learn how the architecture aligns in the cloud however this helps you prepare for audits
or describe key concepts, for design principles. This AWS Well-Architecture Framework program allows you to build a
secure infrastructure, with good high performance, resistant and effective

As we can observe The pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework

- Operational Excellence
- Security
- Reliability
- Performance Efficiency
- Cost Optimization

General Design Principles

- Stop guessing capacity needs
- Test systems at production scale
- Automate to make architectural experimentation easier
- Allow for evolutionary architectures
- Drive architectures using data

#  Reliability

Well-architectureframework plans for failures or downtime, workload, making a way of designing applications and 
workloads to be resilient to failures. However, there are two factors that architects of the cloud creates an 
architecture that resists failure, is reliable, effective, secure, and has availability.

# Availability

In computing it is used to describe the period of time in which the service is available in order to achieve
how time requires that the system respond to a request made by users quickly and efficiently since the
Availability is known as service availability, providing users with reliability in these services,and see the percentage
of time that is available for use.

Factors that influence availability include:

- Fault Tolerance: built in redundancy of a system or application so it can remain operational
- Scalability: ability to accommodate increase or decrease in capacity usage without changing the design
- Recoverability: process, policies, and procedures related to restoring a system after system failure

In this module I learn about cloud architecture, what the meaning of the architecture is, and also what the pillars are.
of this and what benefit it has when designing an architecture that is safe, reliable and effective when developing a new application
to facilitate and enter without any problem and what are its factors.

How reliable is it to create in the cloud where it allows you to have security in the infrastructure?
